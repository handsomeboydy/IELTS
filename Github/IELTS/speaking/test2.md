# What work do you do?
#### Well, I'm still a student in coleege,so I don't have a job,and my major is electrical engineering,so hopefully in the future,I'm be able to work in an electric campany.And I can't just make use of my skills that I obtained during college,and apply them to solving the reality issues.
