# What do you think makes good friends?
*I think making a good friend is a kind of happiness,one reason is that I can share my latest news with my good friends,no matter good or bad,they would send me the best wishes,sharing is also a happy thing,because you know there is someone cares about you,the other reason is that good friends would give me a favour when I am in troubles,also they can make me become a better person with love.*
